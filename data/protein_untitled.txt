===============================================================
PARAMETERS:

The following parameters NEED to be specified (no default values):

parameter            description
--------------------------------
-seq                 hp sequence to be folded in lower case letters (e.g. hhhhpppphhh)
-eng                 optimal energy (specify as a positive value) known or approximated (if not known use large enough number) 
-file                output file

Optional parameters that have default values (same default values for 2D and 3D):

parameter           default value   description
-------------------------------------------------------------
-runs               10              number of independent runs of an algorithm
-tries              1000000         cut-off number for number of iterations (construction-local search-pheromone update) in each run
-time               1000000         cut-off CPU time [sec] per run
-ants               100             number of ants in the colony
-noImprLS           10000           length of local search - number of non improving steps tolerated in each call to local search
-alpha              1               weight for the pheromone information
-beta               2               weight for the heuristic information
-rho                0.8             pheromone persistence
-noise              0.05            theta (pheromone noise)
-elitist_ants       0.01            fraction of elitist ants (updating pheromone matrix, 0 <= elitist_ants <= 1)
-fractLSants        0.5             fraction of ants chosen to perform local search (0 <= fractLSants <= 1)
-probPrev           0.5             probability of keeping previous direction (in long-range move)

./antsystem2D -seq pphpphhpphhppppphhhhhhhhhhpppppphhpphhpphpphhhhh -eng 23 -file seq1_3D -noImprLS 1000 -noise 0.05 -tries 1000000 -runs 3 -ants 100 -alpha 1 -beta 2 -rho 0.8 -elitist_ants 0.01 -fractLSants 0.5 -probPrev 0.5 -time 172800

folding in 3D:

[Parameter settings are outputed; in each run for each improving energy value - Lowest energy we output: CPU time [sec] required to find this solution quality, iteration number in which this solution quality was found, and the actual conformation of a protein in terms of relative directions [s-straight; l-left; r-right; u-up; d-down; g-grounded amino acid (there is a pair of amino acids that serve as the point of reference)].
